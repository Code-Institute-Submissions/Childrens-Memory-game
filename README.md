Childrens Memory Game

In the project Example idea 2 it gave me the idea of doing a "simple single-player pattern-matching memory game" but make it for children,

UX
I changed up the fonts to Bubblegum Sans a more children friendly font I gave it bright colorful colours and made it very easy on the eyes for kids,
I kept it simple and straight forward not to complicate it or younger people, I made the hover feature so they can easily see what image the are about to click.

Features
-Click to play welcome screen, A nice and simple welcome to the game and click anywhere to start the game
-Timer Counts down from 100 seconds to let you know your remaining time before GAME over
-Flips keeps tracks of how many cards you have flipped
-Hover over card back and the question mark grows to let you know what card you are about to click
-Cards flip over to reveal eight pairs of matching animal cards the do an animation when match and turn back over when they are not matched
-Game OVER or You WON! revealed at the end depending on whether you win thje game or not and an option to restart the game



Testing
I have tested this site every way I know how and fixed bugs to which I found.
I cannot at this time find any faults in the code:

 <img class="htmlChecker" src="../img/htmlChecker.png" alt="HTML Checker">


Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project from by watching a number of videos on YouTube:
I started of watching and coding along side (video's below) with the Simon memory game but changed to a memory card game.
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ&t=597s
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0MxUHlZo6U
With the Github code found here:
    https://github.com/code-sketch/memory-game/
When I changed to a memory card Game I again coded along side the video and started with this one"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek",
But changed as I wasnt really feeling the overall project.

I watched a couple more video's and thats when I came across these two video's the HTML and CSS waas the first one I watched"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28VfzEiJgy4" 
And then moved onto the JavaScript video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuQ3g92oPQ" 
I coded along side them and at the end of the two video's I made changes to how it looked to meet the idea I had for my project, I aslo removed some features I thought would complicate it for my intended users.

The code for both youtubers video's can be found here:
