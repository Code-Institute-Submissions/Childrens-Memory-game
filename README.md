#Childrens Memory Game

In the project Example idea 2 it gave me the idea of doing a "simple single-player pattern-matching memory game" but make it for children

##UX
I changed up the fonts to Bubblegum Sans a more children friendly font I gave it bright colorful colours and made it very easy on the eyes for kids,
I kept it simple and straight forward not to complicate it or younger people, I made the hover feature so they can easily see what image the are about to click.

##Features
-Click to play welcome screen, A nice and simple welcome to the game and click anywhere to start the game
-Timer Counts down from 100 seconds to let you know your remaining time before GAME over
-Flips keeps tracks of how many cards you have flipped
-Hover over card back and the question mark grows to let you know what card you are about to click
-Cards flip over to reveal eight pairs of matching animal cards the do an animation when match and turn back over when they are not matched
-Game OVER or You WON! revealed at the end depending on whether you win thje game or not and an option to restart the game



##Testing
I have tested this site every way I know how and fixed bugs to which I found.
I cannot at this time find any faults in the code:

##Acknowledgements
*******I received inspiration for this project from by watching a number of videos on YouTube:
*I started of watching and coding along side (video's below) with the Simon memory game but changed to a memory card game.
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ&t=597s
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0MxUHlZo6U
*With the Github code found here:
    https://github.com/code-sketch/memory-game/
*When I changed to a memory card Game I again coded along side the video and started with this one"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek",
But changed as I wasnt really feeling the overall project.

*I watched a couple more video's and thats when I came across these two video's the HTML and CSS waas the first one I watched"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28VfzEiJgy4" 
And then moved onto the JavaScript video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuQ3g92oPQ" 
*I coded along side them and at the end of the two video's I made changes to how it looked to meet the idea I had for my project, I aslo removed some features I thought would complicate it for my intended users.

*The code for both youtubers video's can be found here:
