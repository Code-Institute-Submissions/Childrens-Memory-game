## UX
I made the fonts to Bubblegum Sans a more child friendly font, I gave it bright colorful colours and made it very easy on the eyes for kids,
I kept it simple and straight forward not to complicate it or younger people, I made the hover feature so they can easily see what image the are about to click.
### Wireframes
* Below is the Images from my start when I designed this with a wireframes:

## Features
### Exisiting Features
* Click to play welcome screen, A nice and simple welcome to the game and click anywhere to start the game
* Timer Counts down from 100 seconds to let you know your remaining time before GAME over
* Flips keeps tracks of how many cards you have flipped
* Hover over card back and the question mark grows to let you know what card you are about to click
* Cards flip over to reveal eight pairs of matching animal cards the do an animation when matched and turn back over when they are not matched
* Game OVER or You WON! revealed at the end depending on whether you win the game or not and an option to restart the game
### Features left to Implement
* I would of liked to have a High score page which could track who has the best high score with a name beside it and count the top 10 scores
* I would like to add sound effects to this project also when cards are matched, you Win or Game Over

## Technologies
* I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this project

### Acknowledgements
* I received inspiration for this project from by watching a number of videos on YouTube:
* I started of watching and coding along side some Simon memory game, video's below: 
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ&t=597s
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0MxUHlZo6U
* With the Github code found here:
    https://github.com/code-sketch/memory-game/
* But changed to a memory card game when I changed to a memory card Game I again coded along side the video and started with this one"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek",
and then watched a couple more But changed as I wasnt really feeling the overall project.

* I watched a couple more video's and thats when I came across these two video's the HTML and CSS waas the first one I watched"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28VfzEiJgy4" 
And then moved onto the JavaScript video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuQ3g92oPQ" 
* I coded along side them and at the end of the two video's I made changes to how it looked to meet the idea I had for my project, I aslo removed some features I thought would complicate it for my intended users.

* The code for both youtubers video's can be found here:
