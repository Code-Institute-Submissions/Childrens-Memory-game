* I would like to add sound effects to this project also when cards are matched, you Win or Game Over
* Resize the Game Over text on Ipad screen size

## Technologies
* I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this project


## Testing
* At the start I had some bugs like for example the images not showwing on the deployed version but showing on Gitpod, I later found out that was down to having the absolute path put in once I removed the "../" it worked fine.
* I tested the colour scheme here: https://coolors.co/
* I tested the JavaScript here: https://jshint.com/
* Below is the results of the HTML test

### Acknowledgements
* I received inspiration for this project from by watching a number of videos on YouTube:
* I started of watching and coding along side some Simon memory game, video's below: 
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ&t=597s
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0MxUHlZo6U
* With the Github code found here:
    https://github.com/code-sketch/memory-game/
* But changed to a memory card game when I changed to a memory card Game I again coded along side the video and started with this one"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek",
and then watched a couple more But changed as I wasnt really feeling the overall project.

* I watched a couple more video's and thats when I came across these two video's the HTML and CSS waas the first one I watched"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28VfzEiJgy4" 
And then moved onto the JavaScript video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuQ3g92oPQ" 
* I coded along side them and at the end of the two video's I made changes to how it looked to meet the idea I had for my project, I aslo removed some features I thought would complicate it for my intended users.

* The code for both youtubers video's can be found here:
